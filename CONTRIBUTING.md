Here is the list of features I am planning to add/need help with

-   Docker: I somehow managed to create a working docker-compose.yml file but I need help with persistance and all. IDK
-   Client: the `up.sh` file attached in the repo is a simple curl wrapper, it doesn't work. if you are a bash expert, show off your skills :D
-   Planning to add a systemd service file soon
-   Maybe somewhere in distant future, I might RiiR
